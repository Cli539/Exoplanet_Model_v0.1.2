The 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded in part to the two astronomers (Mayor and Queloz) who discovered the first exoplanet- a planet that orbits a star other than the Sun. The assignment is to create Python code that will model a planet orbiting a star and that will make predictions about what an astronomer on Earth would observe. This includes the Doppler shift of the light from the star, and variations in light intensity caused by possible eclipses of star by the transiting exoplanet.

This repository contains the fully documented Jupyter Notebook, with code and markup, handed in for the 2019-2020 Eton College Computational Physics Prize. PNG files are included for diagrams within the Notebook and can be found in the images folder.

Various problems have been identified within the code and ongoing development is currently working towards v0.2.
