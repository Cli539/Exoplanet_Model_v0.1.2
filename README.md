The 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded in part to the two astronomers (Mayor and Queloz) who discovered the first exoplanet- a planet that orbits a star other than the Sun. The assignment is to create Python code that will model a planet orbiting a star and that will make predictions about what an astronomer on Earth would observe. This includes the Doppler shift of the light from the star, and variations in light intensity caused by possible eclipses of star by the transiting exoplanet.

This repository contains the fully documented Jupyter Notebook, with code and markup, handed in for the 2019-2020 Eton College Computational Physics Prize. PNG files are included for diagrams within the Notebook and can be found in the images folder.

A latex folder contains a formatted raw latex version with an output pdf file- images and references have been added. 
<em>Important</em>: Note that images both in the Jupyter Notebook and Latex file rely on the relative file path to the "images" and "matplotlib_graph." 
The output pdf is currently the same as found in the root folder. Minor cosmetic changes to the bookmarks have been made. 

Ongoing development is currently working towards v0.2. This will contain an interactive Python file with web-scraping capabilities.
